My name is Samodya 'Sam' Ransara Abeysiriwardane.

I got my BSc. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University in 2016. 
With which I followed my enthusiasm in understanding how computers work 
I got the chance to gain basic understanding from the physics of an electron
to multi-core processor as well as compilers and operating systems.

I obtained my MSc. from the Department of Computer Science, Purdue University in 2018.
During my graduate studies, I followed my budding enthusiasm for databases, concurrency control 
and programming languages.

I would love to connect if you have a job opportunity.
