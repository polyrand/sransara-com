title: About
---
My name is Samodya 'Sam' Abeysiriwardane.

I got my BSc. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University in 2016. 
For which I followed my enthusiasm in understanding how computers work.
I got the chance to gain basic understanding from the physics of an electron
to multi-core processor as well as compilers and operating systems.

I got my MSc. from the Department of Computer Science, Purdue University in 2018.
During my graduate studies, I followed my budding enthusiasm for databases, concurrency control 
and programming language theory.

At the moment I consider myself a generalist. But I am looking for job opportunities to specialize in 
developer tools/programming languages/distributed databases. I would love to connect if you have an opportunity.
